**What is Interpreter?**

**Interpreter**

Interpreter is a computer program that directly executes, i.e. performs, instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution:

1.parse the source code and perform its behavior directly;
2.translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this;
3.explicitly execute stored precompiled code[1] made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system.

Interpreter takes code and translate it into line by line to machine code(ByteCode) which will b executed diretly by CPU.

**Compiler**

Compiler tries to understand what we want to do and takes our language and changes it into something else and this usually happens into something called a lower level language such as macine code.
